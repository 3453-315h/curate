        A tool for fetching archived URLs.

Initial set-up one-liner

  This will clone this repository and then move all scripts to 
  /usr/local/bin.

    $ git clone git@github.com:EdOverflow/curate.git \
      && cp curate/curate /usr/local/bin/ \
      && echo "You can delete the ./curate/ folder now."

  Once you have are done with this one-liner, make sure to 
  include your VirusTotal API key in your .bashrc file. The
  variable should be named 'VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY'.

Dependencies

  - curl
  - jq

Usage

  To fetch archived URLs simply run curate and specify the
  target host.

    $ curate <host>
    $ curate example.com

  If you want to search for strings straight away in the 
  output you can also specify your search term or regular
  expression by using the -r flag.

    $ curate <host> -r <search term>
    $ curate example.com -r example

List of search terms

  Curate outputs the results into a curate.txt file which
  allows you to easily grep through the URLs for keywords.
  Here are some ideas for things to grep for in curate.txt.

  - admin
  - password
  - key
  - api
  - hmac
  - url
  - path
  - redir
  - php
  - id=

  It is advisable to exclude images and stylesheets from your 
  searches by piping everything into 'grep -v'.
